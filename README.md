## [Repository](https://github.com/nahid1991/accessibility-component/)

## Requirements

- ```"@mui/material": "^5.0.0" or "bootstrap": "^5.0.0" and "react-bootstrap": "^2.8.0"```
- ```"react": "^17.0.0"```

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Either add ```"react-accessibility-package": "^0.0.44"``` in ```package.json``` and in terminal run ```npm install```
- Or in the terminal run ```npm install react-accessibility-package```
- Or if you are using yarn run ```yarn add react-accessibility-package```
### Usage
- Import the package by adding ```import { Accessibility } from 'react-accessibility-package'```
- Wrap the entry point component like in the example below:
```
    <Accessibility lang="de" excludedFeatures={[]}>
      <AppHeader />
        <main/>
      <AppFooter />
    </Accessibility>
```
### Props
- ```lang```: This prop determines which language should be used in the component. We currently support setting "en" for English (default) and "de" for German
- ```theme```: Set "bootstrap" for Bootstrap themed component and "mui" for Mui (default) based component. Unless ```react-bootstrap``` is being used do not set the theme as "bootstrap".
- ```excludedFeatures```: This is an array and any string corresponding to the features those will not be rendered in the component. Example: ```excludedFeatures={['BIG_CURSOR']}```. Here the big cursor feature will be excluded from the component. The list of strings we can use to exclude desired features are given below:
  - 'BIG_CURSOR'
  - 'READING_MASK'
  - 'HIGHLIGHT_LINK'
